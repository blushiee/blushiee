hi hi !! I'm blushie.

I'm new to coding and am just interested in it as a little side project for myself since I've been very bored with moving.
I'm mostly just interested in minecraft mods/hacked clients (I am very interested in anaracher/crystal pvp servers).
I don't really have any interest to collaborate with anybody at all since like I said this is just a little fun side project for me right now.
I probably won't use this for a while since I'm still full time invested in finishing school and also don't have a computer currently due to me recently moving and stuff.
